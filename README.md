# Pokedex

Project made by using React JS on front-end with styled-components, back-end was made using Java and Tomcat server, API RESTful as communication, Jupyter Notebook as an assistant and SQL script DDL, DML can be added to any Database. 

### Developers: 
* [Marcos Vinicius Ferreira](https://github.com/marcosnaofazisso) 

## Goals and Rules:
The main goal was to create my first pokedex with nothing more than a excel file with the first gen pokemons data.

The app must not send any forms, so its added just for demo. Also it does have a Pokebag where the use may add up to 6 pokemons and they cannot be duplicated. 
So when it reaches to 6 pokemons, the user must only remove one of them before adding again.

# Data
For this project, I started by using a excel file with all first gen Pokemons, that can be acessed here:
[FirstGenPokemon.csv](https://github.com/marcosnaofazisso/pokedex/files/8933875/FirstGenPokemon.csv)

And manipulating data with Jupyter Notebook (also in this repo). Here's a demo:

# Tutorial
Unfortunately, for his project you'll have to prepare your own development environment on back-end, but I suggest you to get the classes from corresponding directory. 
For front-end, you'll have to install some dependencies like:

    npm install
    npm install --save styled-components
    npm install --save react-router-dom
    npm install --save react-router


## Thank you!
